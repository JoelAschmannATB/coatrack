#
# This is a template for a private local development config file for the CoatRack web application (ygg-admin).
# Personal/private config files override the default values that are defined in "application.yml".
#
# Steps to create your own customized config file:
#  1. Create a copy of this file in the same directory
#  2. Rename the copy as "application-private-[your-profile-name].yml"
#     (follow this naming scheme, so that the file will be ignored by Git and not added to the public repository)
#  3. Adjust the placeholder values in this file to be in line with your local development setup
#  4. Run the CoatRack admin application using the Spring profile "private-[your-profile-name]"
#     (e.g. using your IDE or via the command "sh run-admin-web-application private-[your-profile-name]")
#
# This template includes the most common settings that are usually customized, but you can also add more settings
# if you want to override the default values (see "application.yml" for all configuration options).
